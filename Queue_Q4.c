//Write a menuÂ­driven program that maintains a queue of passengers
//waiting to see a ticket agent. The program user should be able to insert a
//new passenger at the rear of the queue, display the passenger at the front
//of the queue, or remove the passenger at the front of the queue. The
//program will display the number of passengers left in the queue just
//before it terminates.
